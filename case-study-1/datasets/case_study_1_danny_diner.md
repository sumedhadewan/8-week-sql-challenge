### Introduction


Danny love for Japanese food lead him to embark on risky venture opening a little cute resturant serving his 3 favourite foods : sushi , curry , ramen.

Danny is in need of assitance to help the restaurant stay afloat. He want to use basic data collected over few months of operation and answer few simple questions about his customer , their visiting pattern, how much money they've spent and which menu items are their favourite. 
Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver better and more personalized experience for his loyal customers.

Further he plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty progran,

Load Extension


```python
%load_ext sql
```

Initialize connection

It will create a database file with the name dannys_diner under datasets directory, it is not existing already else it will simply initialize the connection to existing database.


I'm using sqlite for this project


```python
%sql sqlite:///datasets/dannys_diner.db
```

### Creating tables in Database

### Table 1 : `sales`

The sales table with three columns - customer id, order_date, product_id.

capturing all customer_id level purchases with an corresponding order_date and product_id information for when and what menu items were ordered


```sql
%%sql 

CREATE TABLE sales (
  "customer_id" VARCHAR(1),
  "order_date" DATE,
  "product_id" INTEGER
);
INSERT INTO sales
  ("customer_id", "order_date", "product_id")
VALUES
  ('A', '2021-01-01', '1'),
  ('A', '2021-01-01', '2'),
  ('A', '2021-01-07', '2'),
  ('A', '2021-01-10', '3'),
  ('A', '2021-01-11', '3'),
  ('A', '2021-01-11', '3'),
  ('B', '2021-01-01', '2'),
  ('B', '2021-01-02', '2'),
  ('B', '2021-01-04', '1'),
  ('B', '2021-01-11', '1'),
  ('B', '2021-01-16', '3'),
  ('B', '2021-02-01', '3'),
  ('C', '2021-01-01', '3'),
  ('C', '2021-01-01', '3'),
  ('C', '2021-01-07', '3');
```

     * sqlite:///datasets/dannys_diner.db
    Done.
    15 rows affected.

### Table 2 : `menu`

The menu table maps the product_id to the actual product_name and price of each menu item.


```sql
%%sql
CREATE TABLE menu(
    "product_id" INTEGER,
    "product_name" VARCHAR(5),
    "price" INTEGER
);
INSERT INTO menu
    ("product_id","product_name","price")
VALUES
    ('1','sushi','10'),
    ('2','curry','15'),
    ('3','ramen','12');
```

     * sqlite:///datasets/dannys_diner.db
    Done.
    3 rows affected.
    




    []




```sql
%%sql
SELECT *
FROM menu
```

     * sqlite:///datasets/dannys_diner.db
    Done.
    




<table>
    <tr>
        <th>product_id</th>
        <th>product_name</th>
        <th>price</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>sushi</td>

    <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>ramen</td>
        <td>12</td>
    </tr>
</table>



### Table 3: `members`

The final members table captures the join_date when a customer_id joined the beta version of the Dannyâ€™s Diner loyalty program


```sql
%%sql
DROP TABLE members
```

     * sqlite:///datasets/dannys_diner.db
    Done.
    




    []




```sql
%%sql
CREATE TABLE members(
    "customer_id" VARCHAR(1),
    "join_date" DATE
);
INSERT INTO members
    ("customer_id","join_date")
VALUES
    ('A','2021-01-07'),
    ('B','2021-01-09');
```

     * sqlite:///datasets/dannys_diner.db

        <td>2021-01-09</td>
    </tr>
</table>




```sql
%%sql

Generating temp table `basic_table` so Danny and his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL


```sql
%%sql

# Case study questions

### 1.  What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?


```sql
%%sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(price) AS total_spent
FROM basic_table
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id
```

     * sqlite:///datasets/dannys_diner.db
    Done.
    




<table>
    <tr>
        <th>customer_id</th>
        <th>total_spent</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>A</td>
        <td>76</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>B</td>
        <td>74</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>C</td>
        <td>36</td>
    </tr>
</table>



### 2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?


```sql
%%sql

SELECT 
    customer_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_date) AS days_vistied 
FROM basic_table
GROUP BY customer_id

```

     * sqlite:///datasets/dannys_diner.db
    Done.
    




<table>
    <tr>
        <th>customer_id</th>
        <th>days_vistied</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>A</td>
        <td>4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>B</td>
        <td>6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>C</td>
        <td>2</td>
    </tr>
</table>



B visited often more than A and C.
But customers may have visited restaurants twice a day.


```sql
%%sql
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    COUNT(order_date) AS days_vistied 
FROM basic_table
GROUP BY customer_id
```

     * sqlite:///datasets/dannys_diner.db
    Done.
    




<table>
    <tr>
        <th>customer_id</th>
        <th>days_vistied</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>A</td>
        <td>6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>B</td>
        <td>6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>C</td>
        <td>3</td>
    </tr>
</table>



### 3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer? 


```sql
%%sql
SELECT
    customer_id,
    GROUP_CONCAT(product_name,',') AS first_item
FROM basic_table t2
WHERE order_date = (
    SELECT MIN(order_date)
    FROM basic_table as t1
    WHERE t1.customer_id = t2.customer_id 
    GROUP BY customer_id
)
GROUP BY customer_id
```

     * sqlite:///datasets/dannys_diner.db
    Done.
    




<table>
    <tr>
        <th>customer_id</th>
        <th>first_item</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>A</td>
        <td>curry,sushi</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>B</td>
        <td>curry</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>C</td>
        <td>ramen,ramen</td>
    </tr>
</table>



Ramen is popular item from the menu

### 4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?


```sql
%%sql
SELECT
    product_name,
    COUNT(*) AS n_times_purchased
FROM basic_table
GROUP BY product_name
ORDER BY n_times_purchased DESC
```

     * sqlite:///datasets/dannys_diner.db
    Done.
    




<table>
    <tr>
        <th>product_name</th>
        <th>n_times_purchased</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>ramen</td>
        <td>8</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>curry</td>
        <td>4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>sushi</td>
        <td>3</td>
    </tr>
</table>



### 5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?


```sql
%%sql
WITH purchase_table AS(
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        product_name,
        COUNT(*) AS n_times_purchased
    FROM basic_table
    GROUP BY customer_id,product_name
),
purchase_rank_table AS(
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        product_name,
        n_times_purchased,
        RANK() OVER (
            PARTITION BY customer_id
            ORDER BY n_times_purchased DESC) AS rank
    FROM purchase_table
)

SELECT 
    customer_id,
    product_name,
    n_times_purchased
FROM purchase_rank_table
WHERE rank = 1
```

     * sqlite:///datasets/dannys_diner.db
    Done.
    




<table>
    <tr>
        <th>customer_id</th>
        <th>product_name</th>
        <th>n_times_purchased</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>A</td>
        <td>ramen</td>
        <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>B</td>
        <td>curry</td>
        <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>B</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>C</td>
        <td>ramen</td>
        <td>3</td>
    </tr>
</table>



Ramen is still popular among Danny's customers

</table>



### 7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member

C is still not a member of loyalty program. so we are excluding C for this enquiry


```sql
%%sql
WITH before_membership AS(
    SELECT *
    FROM basic_table
    WHERE member = 'N' AND 
    customer_id IN (
        SELECT
