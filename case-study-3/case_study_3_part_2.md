Based off the 5 sample customers provided in the sample from the `subscriptions` table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.




```python
%load_ext sql
```


```python
%sql postgresql://postgres:dewan@localhost/foodie
```

There are 1000 Distinct customer_id in `subscription`


```sql
%%sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
FROM subscriptions
